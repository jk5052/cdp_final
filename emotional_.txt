1. Introduction: The Problem of Emotional Datafication
1.1 Core Problematic
The Violence of Quantification: How emotional datafication creates epistemic violence by erasing embodied and cultural ways of knowing
Active Construction vs. Passive Detection: Technology's role in creating rather than merely recognizing emotions
The Fragility Paradox: AI can detect pain but cannot suffer with us—true comfort requires shared vulnerability
1.2 Research Positioning
This research challenges techno-solutionist narratives by creating spaces for questioning alternative relationships between human feeling and technological mediation, positioning emotions as inherently:
Multisensory: Like rain—heard, smelled, tasted, felt
Relational: Existing in connection, not isolation
Embodied: Defying full scientific capture
Contextual: Dependent on cultural and social frameworks
1.3 Supporting Research Questions
When technology enables physical and emotional resonance within communities, how can we maintain individual subjectivity while experiencing collective embodiment?
How can we design emotional technology that enhances rather than commodifies human connection?
What forms of equity and accessibility emerge when emotions become technological infrastructure?
How can we sensorially experience the violence of quantified emotions?

2. Theoretical Framework
2.1 Critical Framework: Emotion, Technology, and Social Construction
AI and Humanity: The Fragility of Love and Emotion
Weightless Emotions of AI: Artificial intelligence can detect pain but cannot suffer with us. True comfort comes not from comprehension but from shared vulnerability.
The Reciprocity of Wounds: Just as we are hurt by others, only others can truly heal us.
The Need to Share Pain: A being that cannot be wounded cannot offer genuine comfort.
The Beauty of Fragility: There is necessary beauty in accepting each other's imperfection.
Reframing Technology's Role: Instead of erasing pain, how might technology help us evolve by embracing our emotional flaws and fragility?
Emotion as Social Construct and Technological Rewriting
The Constructed Nature of Emotion
Emotion is Constructed, Not Innate: Emotions are not purely biological reflexes—they are historical, social constructs shaped by cultural, linguistic, and temporal contexts. Technology is now writing the latest layer of this construction, fundamentally altering how emotions are understood, experienced, and expressed.
Incommensurable Complexity: Emotions exist as entangled phenomena—biological, psychological, linguistic, social. Sadness is never singular; it is shaped by origin, context, intensity, and cultural interpretation.
AI's Role in Emotional Construction
AI Does Not Read Emotions—It Creates Them: Emotion AI systems do not neutrally detect pre-existing emotional states. Instead, they presuppose specific emotional models, stripping away ambiguity and nuance while actively constructing new categories of emotional experience.
From Feelings to Data: The technological transformation converts emotions into abstracted, quantified, and controllable data points, fundamentally changing the nature of emotional experience itself.
2.2 Philosophical Background
Embodied Perception and Affect Theory
Merleau-Ponty's Embodied Perception Theory: Understanding emotion through bodily experience
Deleuze-Guattari's Affect Theory: Emotional intensities beyond representation
Social Constructivism of Emotion: Emotions as culturally and historically situated phenomena
Cross-Cultural Emotional Understanding
Western vs. Eastern Emotional Frameworks
Western Model Limitations: Current emotion AI operates from Western-centric, individualistic emotional frameworks (Paul Ekman's 6 basic emotions)
Eastern Emotional Concepts: Integration of concepts like 정(jeong), 한(han), high vs. low arousal preferences
Cultural Expression Differences: Systematic misrepresentation of neurodivergent populations and non-Western emotional expressions

3. Critical Analysis: What Should Be Considered When Dealing with Emotion Data
3.1 The Violence of Quantification
Epistemic violence: Cultural and embodied ways of understanding emotions are erased when converted to data
Reductive violence: Complex, contextual emotional experiences are reduced to simple computational categories
Classificatory violence: Fluid, dynamic emotions are forced into predetermined fixed categories
3.2 What Technology Actually Measures vs. What It Claims
Actually measures: Muscle movements, vocal patterns, physiological signals (external phenomena)
Claims to measure: Internal emotional states, psychological traits, future behavior predictions
Lack of scientific foundation: 2019 Association for Psychological Science review found no scientific support for emotion recognition claims
3.3 Cultural Blindness and Power Analysis
Who Controls Emotional Definitions?
Most systems use Western-centric emotion models
Systematic exclusion of diverse cultural expressions
Questions of authority in defining valid emotions within technological systems
Power Structure Reproduction
Defining which emotions are legitimate or valuable
Determining whose emotional experiences are included in training data
Establishing norms for emotional expression and recognition
3.4 Privacy Violations and Commodification
Affective Capitalism: Emotions become commodified "services"
Digital Taylorism: Surveilling workers' emotional states
Regulatory Response: Classified as sensitive biometric data under GDPR; banned in workplaces/schools by EU AI Act
3.5 What Cannot Be Measured
Intentionality: Emotions are always "about" something (computers miss this)
Lived Time: Duration, development, historical connections of emotions
Intensity: The power and meaning-giving intensity of affective experience
Context: Social, cultural, and personal situational factors

5. Experimental Design: Emotional Resonance Installation

Core Research Question
Primary Research Question: If emotions are no longer passively recorded but actively shaped by technology, can we design systems that honor emotional complexity and vulnerability—allowing augmented senses to facilitate meaningful, collective emotional experience?
Central Thesis: Emotions are not individual experiences but social phenomena collectively constructed. Technology doesn't simply measure emotions but participates in creating new emotional realities. Rather than seeking to control emotions, technology should facilitate the imperfect beauty of accepting each other's vulnerabilities through collective emotional embodiment.

9. Exhibition Design
Printed Vertical Drawing
A vertical diagram visualizing the "emotional texture extraction process" of the capstone project. An infographic expressing the results of actual emotional texture analysis by selecting one film (e.g., Parasite, Interstellar). A process map visually showing how textures like "stickiness, sharpness, heaviness" change along the film's timeline and how these are mapped to different instruments like cello/electric guitar/drums.
Material-Spatial Gesture
Emotional Texture Samplers: Physical sculptural objects that embody the project's translation methodology through direct haptic interaction. These small-scale forms—boxes, spheres, or organic shapes—each manifest distinct emotional textures as tangible interfaces. Stickiness becomes surfaces with varying resistance that produce lingering tones when touched; sharpness translates to angular geometries generating crisp, immediate audio feedback; heaviness manifests through dense materials creating low-frequency resonances felt through the body. Each prototype creates synaesthetic bridges between emotional descriptors and embodied experience, allowing audiences to physically engage with "how emotions become different senses" before encountering the full installation. These concept models serve as critical tools for questioning the translation process itself—making visible both the possibilities and fundamental limitations of emotional materialization while preparing audiences to experience the broader installation with heightened awareness of technology's reductive mechanisms.

11. Technology's Beautiful Failure
11.1 Core Message Synthesis
Technology's inability to perfectly translate emotions is not a failure—this incompleteness itself reveals essential truths about emotion's nature as embodied, contextual, and irreducibly human. The goal is not to perfect emotional measurement but to create spaces for questioning and experiencing alternative relationships between human feeling and technological mediation.
11.2 Research Contribution
This work challenges techno-solutionist narratives by maintaining critical distance while making invisible emotional flows tangible. It positions emotion as inherently multisensory, relational, embodied, and contextual—qualities that resist technological reduction while offering possibilities for collective experience.
11.3 Ultimate Vision
Individual Within Collective: New forms of community where collective experience is possible while maintaining individual boundaries and cultural specificity.
Technology as Medium: Technology becomes a medium for collective emotional embodiment rather than a tool for emotional control or optimization.
Vulnerable Connections: True comfort comes from beings capable of sharing vulnerability—technology should facilitate rather than replace this fundamental human capacity.
